Web Development Modernization Proposal
Introduction

Our current LAMP-based stack with Bootstrap/jQuery has served us well but limits our ability to move fast, reduce bugs, and deliver modern, dynamic experiences.
This proposal outlines a phased plan to modernize our frontend technology stack, development workflows, and mobile accessibility strategy to:

    Reduce time-to-market for new projects and features

    Improve stability and reduce post-launch issues

    Deliver engaging, mobile-friendly, and accessible websites

    Support a future-ready development culture

We will focus on three areas:

    Frontend Modernization – Moving away from Bootstrap/jQuery toward React + TypeScript + a modern UI framework

    Automation & Documentation – Using GitHub and CI/CD pipelines to streamline builds, testing, and deployments

    Mobile-First & Progressive Web Apps (PWA) – Designing for mobile as a primary experience and enabling offline, app-like functionality

1. Frontend Modernization
Reduce reliance on jQuery & Bootstrap

    Why phase out jQuery?

        Bloated and requires extra libraries for animations, carousels, etc.

        Less relevant in a modern, component-driven web environment.

    Why phase out Bootstrap?

        Dependency on jQuery

        Can lead to a “generic” design aesthetic

Adopt React + TypeScript

    React Benefits

        Component-based architecture pairs naturally with Aurora4’s modular design

        Virtual DOM enables faster, smoother UI updates without full page reloads

        State management supports persistent UI preferences (dark mode, language, etc.)

        Rich ecosystem of third-party libraries for complex features

        Easy integration with Aurora4 APIs for real-time updates and secure front/back separation

    TypeScript Benefits

        Strong typing prevents common bugs at compile time

        Acts as built-in documentation

        Improves IDE autocomplete and code navigation

        Industry standard for large-scale, maintainable applications

UI Framework Options

    TailwindCSS

        Utility-first approach for consistent styling without heavy custom CSS

        Highly customizable with pre-defined colors, fonts, and spacing

        Small learning curve but highly flexible

    Material UI

        React component library with built-in theming

        Speeds up development but may risk a generic look if overused

2. Automation & Documentation
GitHub & CI/CD Pipelines

By standardizing on GitHub and automated deployment workflows, we can:

    Spin up new frontends from a shared boilerplate

    Isolate development work to prevent overwrites

    Automate bug detection, security scans, and ADA compliance checks

    Deploy automatically to Staging for testing before pushing to Production

    Eliminate manual FTP uploads by integrating directly with cPanel

    Maintain full version history for easy rollbacks

    Securely store API keys and passwords in GitHub

Staging Environments

    Every site has Production and Staging

    Dev branches deploy automatically to Staging for review

    Only tested, approved changes are merged into Production

Proposed Development Workflow

    New Project

        Create GitHub repo from boilerplate

        Set up Production & Staging environments

    Feature Development

        Create feature branch (e.g., “john-homepage-redesign”)

        Push branch to GitHub → automatic deployment to Staging

    Testing

        Automated checks run (linting, unit tests, security scans)

        Manual QA review in Staging

    Deployment

        Merge to main → automatic Production deployment

Knowledge & Documentation

    Storybook

        Build, test, and document UI components for reuse

        Acts as a living style guide

    Wiki

        Document Aurora4 features, workflows, and coding standards

        Accessible to both developers and stakeholders

3. Mobile-First & Progressive Web Apps
Mobile-First Design

    Treat mobile experience as the primary focus, not an afterthought

    Improves SEO (Google indexes mobile-first)

    Prioritize performance, touch accessibility, and responsive layouts

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)

    Built with React to share codebase with main site

    Installable on mobile home screens like native apps

    Support offline use, push notifications, and background syncing

    Enhance user retention and engagement

Proposed Implementation Plan

Phase 1 – Establish GitHub Standard Processes

    Choose CI/CD tools and automation integrations

    Test and refine workflow

    Document final process and train developers

Phase 2 – Frontend Migration

    Choose UI framework (TailwindCSS or Material UI)

    Integrate React + TypeScript with Aurora4

    Build a pilot project using the new stack and pipeline

    Document and train developers

Future Opportunities

    Testing & Quality: Jest, PHPUnit, Cypress, Playwright, Lighthouse

    Performance: Next.js for SSR/SSG, image optimization pipelines

    Hosting & Infrastructure: Vercel, Supabase, Docker-based environments

    UX Enhancements: Micro-frontends, AI-assisted search, advanced accessibility tooling
